    <br><p> this is a guide to some key mechanics in warthunder </p>
    <br>
    <br><def><h3>Ammuinition (ground forces)</h3></def>
    <br>
    <br><p>Remember try to take as few rounds into battle with you as possible as you will be less suscptable to ammo racking, this is where your ammo is hit and it explodes destroying the tank.</p>
    <br>
    <br><h4>APHE</h4>
    <br> <img src=images/APHE.jpg alt=APHE>
    <br><p>APHE or Armour Piercing, High Explosive is possibly the most common and most effective general purpose ammuition at low to mid tiers, it generaly has average levels of penetraion less than most other types however its explosive filler has a devastating effect on occupants and systems inside vehicles usually resulting in a single shot taking out an enemy vehicle</p>
    <br><h4>AP/shot</h4>
    <br> <img src=images/AP.png alt=AP>
    <br><p>AP or Armour Piercing sometimes referred to as shot especially in the British tech tree where it is most commonly seen is literaly just a solid metal round that has generally better penetration than APHE due to its explosive filler being pelaced by more metal mass however its post penetration effect is less impactful and can leave you having to target key individual components and occupants in the vehicle.  </p>
    <br><h5>Caps</h5>
    <br> <p>Both APHE and AP can have Caps, these are devices plased on the nose of the shell to either increase aerodynamics in terms of a ballistic cap or increase the likelihood of penetration on armoured plate in terms of just a cap, some rounds are both capped and ballistic capped such as the american M61 shell.</p>
    <br><h4>HE</h4>
    <br> <img src=images/HE.jpg alt=HE>
    <br><p>HE or High Explosive is basically just a explosive and has very little armour penetration, it is usually ineffective against vehicles in warthunder however if you have a large enough calibre weapon the high explosive basically over matches the armour destroying the vehicle. it can also be used to get trap shots these are shots where you shoot under the rings of the turret or at the belly of the tank, but otherwise should be avoided if you wish to remain competitive</p>
    <br><h4>APCR</h4>
    <br> <img src=images/APCR.jfif alt=APCR>
    <br><p>Armour Piercing Composite Rigid or APCR for short is an like an AP or shot shell but however has a hardened composite core which can equal to higher penetration apcr has the same down sides as AP but can penetrate much thicker armour to its equivalents and when found in the PzII DAK's autocannon is extremley deadly as by the time the enemy realises theyre being shot half the crew are wiped out the engines gone and the gun breech is swiss cheese and its back to the hangar for them.</p>
    <br><h4>APDS/APFSDS</h4>
    <br> <img src=images/APFSDS.jfif alt=APFSDS>
    <br><p>Armour Piercing Discarding Sabot, APDS  for short, and Armour Piercing, Fin Stabilised, Discarding Sabots. are functionally identical however one just has the addition of fins to stabilise the trajectory and is found at higher tiers, but functionally they are both hardened rods usual tungsten or depleted uranium that come bundled up with sabots which are there only to help build the pressure whilst in the gun and are discarded upon leaving the barrels they need the sabots to engage in the rifling and retain pressure as these rounds are much smaller diameter than the guns their fired from, due to this they focus aloty of energyu onto a small area which helps with penetration. on the note of engaging with rifling, fin stabilised does not require this as such most modern tanks now have smooth bore guns. </p>
    <br><h4>HEAT/HEAT-FS/HESH</h4>
    <br> <img src=images/HESH.jpg alt=HESH>
    <br><p>HEAT or High Explosive Anti-Tank with the FS notation reflect the fin stabilised variant is a shaped charged projectile which uses a cone of metal which upon impact explodes on the armour creating  a stream of molten metal that penertrates the armour ,however one must be careful as any fences, shrubery, tank grates, or ERA armour in the way of HEAT or HESH can negate the effects completely by causing a premature explosion.<br>HESH or High Explosive Squash Head, is one my favourite round as its name denotes Squash head, flattens on impact like an angry playdoh it then explodes after a short delay causiong the inside armour of the vehicle or bulding splinter spawl and fragment turning what was their protection into what is only a cruel irony their demise.</p>  <br><h4>Missiles/Rockets</h4>
    <br> <img src=images/HEAT.png alt=HEAT>
    <br><p>Missiles and rockets come in many shapes and sizes but usually have HE or HEAT war heads, some are guided and are absolutely devastating. and some have proximity fuses however they are all generally HE or HEAT and are just propelled by rockets</p>
    <br><h4>Smoke</h4>
    <br><p>quite simply wherever the shell lands a giant smoke cloud is going to be formed this is really effective if you need to cross open ground and need to conceal your position, you can use it to blind the enemy for a retreat or even in special cases be used to mark an enemy whilsts blinding them at the same as if your with your buddys and you shoot your smoke at an enemy and you all start firing into the cloud of smoke there is a good chance you will hit him this is good for tight ambush locations where yuou can funnel fire</p>
    <br><h4>Shrapnel</h4>
    <br><p>only use these if you wanna play the game on super hard mode, they are literaly the worst round in the game. do not take these i couldnt even tell you how they function because they just dont. what i think is supposed to happen is that the first portion of the projectile when it impacts comes of then the rest of the shell as it is being resisted by the armour is slower to pass through so lets the end of the shell part from it releasing shrapnel that was inside the shell killing the inhabitants but in reality, it does nothing as even the thinnest sheet of armour is enough to stop it and considerning it needs armour to in effect set off the projectile its useless and you would have more luck just using the coaxial machine guns.</p></def>
