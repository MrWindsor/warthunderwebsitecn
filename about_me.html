    <br><def><h2>About Me</h2>
    <br> <p>I'll try to keep this brief.<br> Hi im Mr Windsor, ive been playing warthunder since about 2012 when i initially got the PS4 i didnt have many games and i was looking around and i noticed this game on the PS store for the bargain price of FREE, so iwas like oo that looks fun and downloaded it, iinitailly there were only air vehicles and being british i focused on the british tech tree, i played it on and off for years then armoured vehicles came out and i fell in love with the game, i loved the accuracy of the vehicles the intricate damage modules it was perfect, so a few years i played on ps4 then a couple years ago i got a gaming pc at first i used my origanl ps4 account then as i wanted to buy premium and no longer having a ps4 i started again from the ground up with my current PC account then about 6 months later they allowed you to delink youtr psn account from your warthunder account so that was funnyXD, soo yhh thats why i decide to make this website for my coding course, its a small passion of mine alongside the coding that i figured id be able to make a relitively in depth guide for now youll find out about my favourite vehicles you can find in warthunder.</p></def>

            <br><def class=blockbg><h3>My Favourite Tanks/AFVS</h3>
            <br><def><h4>Centurion Mk3</h4>
                <img src=images/Centurion.jpg alt= centurion>
            <br><p>The Centurion Mk 3 in warthunder is a tier IV Main Battle Tank and sits at battle rating(br) 7.3, its 20 pounder cannon has amazing penetration however still uses the british shot and APDS so post pen damage can be limited, the vehicle is highly mobile and possesses decent armour but dont rely on it to save you as at this br most things will be able to pen you from multiple angles. the best feature of this tank is its weapons system  with its two plane stabilisation helping with firing on the move and the range it can be used effectively however its speed and mobility are nothing to push aside especially for its class, its ability to bring such firepower to bear at positions the opposing forces will be left in bewilderment and will leave many returning to the hangar or coming out with only AA.<br>
            The Reason this is on my Top 5 favourite Tanks, is just that it is a classic british tank design and at its time was one of the greatest tanks seeing wide usage by many nations. it has its heritage rooted in WW2 as at the time the western allies were pushing through the fields of germany, the prototypes and mk1 variants were running round salisbury plains and to think their were variants of this vehicle still seeing use in the first gulf war with only 3 being lost due to accidents involving vehicle fires and subsequent ammunition explosions only 4 minor injuries occured, however not a single loss in combat, the vehicle is still in use by some nations such as the South African Olifant, which is amazing for a vehicle that can be traced back to WW2. </p></def>
            <br><def><h4>FV4202</h4>
                <img src=images/FV4202.png alt= fv4202>
            <br><p>The F4202 is another tier IV tank and at br 7.0 again possessing the powerful 20 pounder cannon it has the same abilitys as the centurion as above however has an awful reverse speed but a better turret design with distinctive slope, a very small mantlet area, the turret is suprisingly effective at deflecting and even stopping shots at this far due to its volumetric shape so you have to be more careful when getting into a flanking manouvere as you can not reverse out of it as quickly than as with the other british vehicles around this battle rating.  <br>
            The Reason this is on my Top 5 favourite Tanks, is just its amazing looks and its similar performance to the centurion being derived from it as a cheiftain prototype, also every time i play this vehicle i seem do very well especially when taking advantage of its great depression and turret this is a great hull down fighter only let down by its reverse speed it represents very well what youll get in the future tech tree from british MBTs.  </p></def>
            <br><def><h4>T34</h4>
                <img src=images/T34-85.jpg alt=T34 >
            <br><p>The T34 series honestly i couldnt just choose 1 the vehich goes from strength to strength as it goes from BR 3.3 to 5.7 starting off with 76mms whch are adequate for the BR to a 57mm that seems to punch a hole through pretty much anything it will normally face from even the most surreal of distances and the infamous T34-85 with its monster 85 mm cannon that eviscerates any that fall into its crosshairs, and its armour being made of 'Stalinium' can bounce and deflect even som of the most powerful rounds in the game i belive it is this tank that paved way for the term RUSSIAN BIAS  <br>
            The Reason this is on my Top 5 favourite Tanks, is because Russian BIAS its such an iconic vehicle it couldnt not be added to the list of favourite tanks, from playing call of duty and getting to ride one of these in world at war, to seeing it in all the great war films even in saving private ryan where she dressed up as a tiger and thats not the first or only time the t34 has snook onto a movie set as another tank, for one main reason the t34s still workto this day.</p></def>
            <br><def><h4>Toyota Megacruiser</h4>
                <img src=images/type_93.jpg alt=Toyota >
            <br><p> i here you this is neither a tank or armoured vehicle however its really cool and is in the game as the Type 93  with an SAM launcher on its bed. at br 9.7 its an incredible anti air vehicle with its highspeed and 8 surface to air missiles it can keep the skys clear of any pesky jets and helicopters to let your tankers tank. however if anything even looks at you remeber you are only a soft skinned vehicle so even machine gun fire can put a stop to your antics<br>
            Honestly this is my wildcard ive always been a massive fan of toyotas and imparticular their classic hiluxs and landcruisers and finding out they have an even bigger militarised truck is just awesome. so this gets to be on my list  because i like toyota trucks and the megacruiser has to be the top of them and if i had the money i would definitely roll around in one of these.  </p></def>
            <br><def><h4>Challenger 2</h4>
                <img src=images/Challenger2.jpg alt=Challie2 >
            <br><p>It had to be a British Tank again at the top of the list sitting at 10.7 the highest BR in the game, top tier gameplay is very different from low to mid tier and due to this being a game advantages that a challenger 2 would have in real world dont portray correctly within the game making this honestly one of the weakest contenders at top tier as it doesnt possess the highest mobility and the armour meta at top teir is non existant so with this vehicle you really want to hold back and use its amazing gun depression and fight from the hull down position using its powerful cannon to dispatch the opposition.  <br>
            The Reason this is on the top of my 5 favourite tanks is probably a little British Pride and it just looks like the meanest bit of kit on the battlefield, its technological advancements over its predecssors and competitors at the time of its inception such as the hunter killer system which has now been adopted by many other nations.</p></def></def>
